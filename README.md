Hello, Im Steper Meada
I am a GIS Python programmer. I use ArcGis Pro and ESRI ArcMap Desktop. I have been doing GIS work for the Last 15 years.
I also do design work using Adobe Products and use Microsodt Office products. My database system of choice is SQL Server but
have also used MySQL and Postgres database systems.
